		<br>
		<p><strong>Bugbee Geological Services</strong> was founded in 2018 and is located in Yukon, Oklahoma. Our team of dedicated wellsite geologists have over 100 years of combined experience in all of the major plays in Oklahoma, and have logged wells for companies such as Continental Resources, XTO Energy, and Trailhead Exploration.  Our work ethic and attention to detail are second to none, while we constantly strive to exceed our client's expectations. We believe that hard work is undefeated.  Our value of consistent integrity mixed with our level of expertise in this field are what put us a cut above the rest.  As oil & gas companies currently look to expand their drilling plans, we also seek to grow as we further cement ourselves into the oil & gas landscape.</p>
