				<li>Mudloggers will be responsible for catching and cleaning their own samples.</li>
				<li>Daily mud logs, company man & geological reports sent to a provided distribution list. </li>
				<li>Sample pictures included on mud log for each formation encountered in the vertical portion, and throughout the horizontal.</li>
				<li>Daily correlations provided through the vertical & curve portion of well, and as needed for upcoming zones of interest.</li>
				<li>We also provide a set of dry samples at the end of the well, or can mail to a lab of your choice.</li>

		<p class="pmudlog">We utilize the state of the art Bloodhound brand natural gas detector and chromatograph system produced by I-Ball Instruments, based on patented infrared sensors that are much more reliable than hotwire and FID gas sensors.  In addition to total gas, the Bloodhound measures chomat analysis of C1-NC5 (methane to normal pentane), as well as H2S and CO2.  It is compatible for WITS with Pason and Totco computer rig systems.  Also, as needed, we can supply you with a login and password to watch rig activity remotely from your phone or computer.  For any additional information on I-Ball Instruments and the Bloodhound, feel free to check out their website: <a href="https://iballinst.com/bloodhound/" target="_blank">www.iballinst.com/bloodhound.</a>
